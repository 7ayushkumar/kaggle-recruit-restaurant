# Kaggle recruit restaurant solution

My solution ranked 8th out of 2216 on the [Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting). The solution focuses on targeted feature engineering and LightGBM cross-validation.

1. Have Python 3 installed
2. Download the Kaggle data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting/data)
3. Download the weather data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/huntermcgushion/rrv-weather-data)
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (using a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) is good practice)
5. [Install LightGBM](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation-Guide.html)
6. Run `jupyter notebook`
7. Open the `Solution.ipynb` notebook
